Description: bPeaks is a simple approach to identify transcription factor binding sites from ChIP-seq data. Our general philosophy is to provide an easy-to-use tool, well-adapted for small eukaryotic genomes (< 20 Mb). bPeaks uses a combination of 4 cutoffs (T1, T2, T3 and T4) to mimic "good peak" properties as described by biologists who visually inspect the ChIP-seq data on a genome browser. For yeast genomes, bPeaks calculates the proportion of peaks that fall in promoter sequences. These peaks are good candidates as transcription factor binding sites.
