bPeaks-package          bPeaks: an intuitive peak-calling strategy to
                        detect transcription factor binding sites from
                        ChIP-seq data in small eukaryotic genomes
bPeaksAnalysis          Function to run the entire bPeaks procedure
baseLineCalc            Function to calculate the average number of
                        reads mapped on each nucleotide in a genome
dataPDR1                ChIP-seq results (IP and control samples)
                        obtained with the transcription factor Pdr1 in
                        yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
dataReading             Function to import sequencing results in R
dataSmoothing           Function to smooth sequencing coverage along a
                        chromosome
peakDetection           Peak calling method, i. e. identification of
                        genomic regions with a high density of
                        sequences (reads)
peakDrawing             Function to draw graphical representations of
                        genomic regions detected using bPeaks
                        methodology
peakLocation            Function to locate detected basic peaks
                        (bPeaks) according to predifined chromosomal
                        features
