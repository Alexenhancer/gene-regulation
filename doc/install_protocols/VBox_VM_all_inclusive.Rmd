# Executing Snakemake workflows on a Virtual Box virtual machine 

------------------------------------------

## Requirements

### Virtualbox software

We used VirtualBox 5.0.2, downloadable from [https://www.virtualbox.org/](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or to be installed manually:
```
sudo apt-get install virtualbox-5.0
```
VirtualBox extension pack can be requested (eg. for handling USB2.0, see 'errors' section).
```
wget http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.0.2/Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-5.0.2.vbox-extpack
```

### Base Ubuntu image 

In this tutorial we used Ubuntu 14.04.3, latest long-term supported version.
```
wget http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/ubuntu-14.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso
```
------------------------------------------


## Creation of the virtual machine

1. Open VirtualBox

2. Click on the **New** button. 

3. Parameters

- Name and operating system

    - Name: gene-regulation
    - Type: Linux
    - Version: Ubuntu (64 bits)
    
- Memory size:	2048 Mb (this can be modified afterwards). 

- Hard drive:	*Create a virtual hard drive now*. 

- Hard drive file type: *VDI* (VirtualBox Disk Image).


<!--
- Hard drive file type: *VMDK* (Virtual Machine Disk). 

    I chose this option because it ensures a wider compatibility with other OS and Virtual Machine management systems. 

	   Another potential advantage of VMDK is that it enables to split virtualdisks in files <=2Gb, which is convenient to store them on FAT partitions. 
-->

- Storage on physical hard drive
    - Select *Dynamically allocated*
    
<!--
    - Activate the option *Split into files less than 2Gb*, which allows to store the VM on FAT partitions for Windows host machines.
-->

- File location and size
    - max size of virtual hard drive:	    30GB
    - click on **Create** button

*Note:* you should adapt the virtual hard drive size to your needs. Be aware that it's difficult to extend later on, so you should aim larger than expected. Since the size is dynamically allocated, it won't take up too much space until you fill it. 
<!--
        Beware: the size has to be larger than you real needs, because Ubuntu will automatically create some big  partitions (/dev and /run/shm). Since we allow dynamical memory allocation, it is fine to set the max size to 18Gb, which will be grossly assigned as follows:

        - max 14Gb for the root partition /
        - 2Gb for /dev
	      - 2Gb for /run/user
-->



At this stage, the VM has been created and needs to be configured before installing the operating system. 


## Virtual Box configuration

Before configuring the virtual machine, we need to tell VirtualBox how it will enable your local virtual machines to interact with their host (the operating system of the machine on which the VM is running).

1. Open *VirtualBox > File > Preferences...*

2. Open the tab *Network* > *Host-only Networks*
     - click on the "+" icon
     - this creates a network vboxnet0. Select this network, click on the screw driver icon (*edit host-only network*), and set the following options:

      - *Adapter* tab
          - IPv4 Address: 192.168.56.1
          - IPv4 Network Mask: 255.255.255.0
          - IPv6 Adress: blank
          - IPv6 Network Mask Length: 0

      - *DHCP Server* tab
          - Check *Enable Server*
          - *Server Address:* 192.168.56.100
          - *Server Mask:* 255.255.255.0
          - *Lower Address Bound:* 192.168.56.101
          - *Upper Address Bound:* 192.168.56.254

## Virtual Machine configuration

In the VirtualBox main window, select the newly created virtual machine, and click on the **Settings** button. 

### General 

For the desktop version of Ubuntu, it is convenient to enable copy-paste between the guest and the host.

- Select the tab *Advanced*
- Set *Shared clipboard* to *Bidirectional*

### Storage

Click on the **Empty** disc icon in the storage tree. Select the disc icon on the right and fetch the downloaded `.iso` image(see **Requirements**).
Click on *OK*.


### Network

VirtualBox offers many alternative ways to configure network communications between the virtual machine, the host machine, and the external network. 

To get more information about network settings: 

* VirtualBox manual page: [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html)
* An excellent tutorial: [http://christophermaier.name/blog/2010/09/01/host-only-networking-with-virtualbox](http://christophermaier.name/blog/2010/09/01/host-only-networking-with-virtualbox)

We present here one possible way to configure your Virtual machine, but this should be adapted to the particular security/flexibility requirements of the network where the maching has to run. 


In the VM settings, select tne *Network* tab. VirtualBox enables you to specify several adapters, each corresponding to one separate network access (e.g. using an ethernet card + wi-fi connection).

- click on the tab *Adapter 1*,
- check *Enable Network Adapter*
- Attached to: *Host-only Adapter*
- Name: *vboxnet0* (this network must have been created beforehand)

#### Additional networks


**BEWARE!** If you activate this adaptor your VM will be visible from external computers in the same network as the host  machine.

See information at: [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_bridged](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_bridged)

- click on the tab *Adapter 2*,
    - check *Enable Network Adapter*
    - Attached to : *Bridged Adapter*
    - Name: choose an option corresponding to the actual internet connection of the host machine (e.g. ethernet cable, Wi-Fi, ...).

Note: you can also activate a third adapter, for example to support both an ethernet card (Adapter 2) and a Wi-Fi connection (Adapter 3). This is particularly interesting for laptop computers. 




**You can now start the VM. **

This can raise several errors, if so see dedicated section below. 



## Operating system installation

* Welcome 
    - check the language settings and click on *Install Ubuntu*.

* Preparing to install Ubuntu
	  - leave all default parameters and click *Continue*.

* Installation type
	  - (leave the default) Erase disk and install Ubuntu, click *Install Now*.

* Where are you (automatic)
      - Paris

* Keyboard layout
      - French - French

* Who are you ?
      - Your name:			        gene-regulation
      - Your computer's name:	gene-regulation-virtual
      - Pick a username: 		  gr
      - Choose a password:     genereg
      - (Activate the option Log in automatically)
      
Restart once installation is completed. 

Once on the desktop, go to the VM menu: select *Devices* then *Install Guest Additions CD image*.
Run it. 

The VirtualBox Guest Additions will provide closer integration between host and guest and improve the interactive performance of guest systems.
Reboot again to see the new display.



## Basic installation

Once in the virtual machine, you can install the required programs. 

1. Clone the git sakemake repository and get inside.

```
sudo apt-get --yes install git
git clone https://github.com/rioualen/gene-regulation.git
cd gene-regulation
```

2. Run makefile to install all required dependencies (this may take a while ~20mn?) & source ngs_bashrc (containing the `$PATH` for applications).

```
make -f scripts/makefiles/makefile_install_dependencies all
source ~/bin/ngs_bashrc ## TODO
```

## Run the workflow

1. Download source data

```
sudo mkdir -p /data/GSE20870/GSM521934 /data/GSE20870/GSM521935
sudo chown -R ubuntu-user:ubuntu-user /data
cd /data/GSE20870/GSM521934
wget ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/sra-instant/reads/ByExp/sra/SRX%2FSRX021%2FSRX021358/SRR051929/SRR051929.sra
cd /data/GSE20870/GSM521935
wget ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/sra-instant/reads/ByExp/sra/SRX%2FSRX021%2FSRX021359/SRR051930/SRR051930.sra
```

<!--
```
/data/
    GSE20870/
        GSM521934/
            SRR051929.sra
        GSM521935/
            SRR051930.sra
```
```
rsync -rtvplu /data/GSE20870 root@192.54.201.124:/data
```
-->

2. Run the workflow.

```
cd ~/gene-regulation
snakemake -p -s scripts/snakefiles/workflows/factor_workflow.py
```

Congratulations! You just executed this wonderful workflow:

## Visualize the results

The Virtual Machine created here doesn't have a graphical interface, so we're gonna use a distant desktop to visualize the results from the host machine. 

1. Install the x2go client and launch it from your **local computer**.

```
sudo apt-get install x2goclient
```


2. Get the IP of your virtual machine.
```
ifconfig
```


2. Copy your ssh key to the authorized keys of the virtual machine.

```
cat $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh root@192.54.201.124 "cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys"
```

3. Launch client.

```
x2goclient
```

4. Create a new session using the Mate desktop.

![](img/x2goclient_session_create.png)

5. The session now appears on the right panel. Just click it to lauch it!

![](img/x2go_launch_session.png)

6. You should be now on the virtual desktop!

![](img/mate.png)

7. You can visualize FastQC results using firefox.

![](img/fastqc.png)

8. You can visualize the peaks by running IGV from the terminal.

```
PATH=$PATH:/root/bin
igv
```
Click "File" > "Open session..." and chose the file `/root/mydisk/data/results/GSE20870/peaks/igv_session.xml`.

# what to do with this ? 


## Connection to VM through the host machine. ---> what to do here

**In the VM terminal: **
```
sudo apt-get install --quiet --assume-yes ssh ## install ssh
ifconfig ## get the IP
```
**In the host's terminal:**
```
ssh gene-regulation@192.168.56.101 ## access the VM by ssh using its IP address
```
**Note:** If you're running or have been running several virtual machines, you might encounter problems with the host's known keys
when trying to connect to your VM via `ssh`, such as: 
```
WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!
Add correct host key in $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending ECDSA key in $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts:16
  remove with: ssh-keygen -f "$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts" -R 192.168.56.101
ECDSA host key for 192.168.56.101 has changed and you have requested strict checking.
```
In such case, just proceed with the recommended command, which will remove previous connection parameters for the IP address:
```
ssh-keygen -f "$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts" -R 192.168.56.101
```
Once you're connected to the VM via `ssh`, you can upload your ssh parameters with:
```
rsync -ruptvl gene-regulation@192.168.56.101:.ssh .
ssh-agent > ~/agent
source ~/agent
ssh-add
```


## VirtualBox connection errors

### When starting VirtualBox

```
Kernel driver not installed (rc=-1908)

The VirtualBox Linux kernel driver (vboxdrv) is either not loaded or there is a permission problem with /dev/vboxdrv. Please reinstall the kernel module by executing

'/etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup'

as root. If it is available in your distribution, you should install the DKMS package first. This package keeps track of Linux kernel changes and recompiles the vboxdrv kernel module if necessary.

```

Proposed solution: type command in host terminal and then restart VBox. 
```
sudo /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup
```
