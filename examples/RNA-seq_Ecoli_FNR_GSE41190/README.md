# Study case for the development of a Bacterial RNA-seq workflow


## Data source

Reference: Myers KS, Yan H, Ong IM, Chung D et al. Genome-scale analysis of escherichia coli FNR reveals complex features of transcription factor binding. PLoS Genet 2013 Jun;9(6):e1003565. PMID: [23818864](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23818864)


GEO series: [GSE41190](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE41190)


## File organisation

The short reads were downloaded from SRA ftp site using the links in the Excel file samples.xlsx. In this dataset, there is a single run per sample, and thus a single sra file per GSM ID. 

Short read files (.sra) are stored in sample-specific folders named data/source/[GSM_ID].
