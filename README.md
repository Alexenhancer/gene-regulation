This git repository holds shared code for the analysis of Next
Generation Sequencing data related to gene regulation: ChIP-seq,
RNA-seq, and related technologies. 

We have chosen to use the [Snakemake workflow management system](https://bitbucket.org/snakemake/snakemake/wiki/Home)[1] 
in order to build reproducible and flexible NGS analysis pielines.

# Snakemake workflows

Snakemake is a tool that enables the creation of analysis pipelines, based on the python language and the make concepts of rules and targets. 

A rule contains the commands to generate a given target. 
A workflow can be defined as a series of files generated by successive rules. 

Here, we present a repository of reusable NGS-specific rules, as well as a few workflow examples for standard ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses. 

# Workflow example

Our workflows are meant to work using two main files: a so-called workflow file (\*.py) and a configuration file (\*yml).
The first one contains the targets to be generated, and the second one contains the necessary and optional parameters 
to manage and customize the workflow. 

Here, we will show how to execute the [ChIP-seq workflow](https://github.com/rioualen/gene-regulation/blob/master/scripts/snakefiles/workflows/factor_workflow.py) `factor_workflow.py`.

In the [example directory](https://github.com/rioualen/gene-regulation/blob/master/examples) you will find several case studies. We will use the `GSE20870` yeast study. It comes with three tab-delimited files: 

* `merge.tab` contains the information for merging lanes;
* `samples.tab` contains a description of each samples;
* `design.tab` contains the samples to be compared. 

The `yml` configuration file contains the paths to the data to be analysed, as well as the data to be generated. 
Here, we analyse raw samples (\*.sra) located in the `/data` directory: 

```
/data/
    GSE20870/
        GSM521934/
            SRR051929.sra
        GSM521935/
            SRR051930.sra
```
It is assumed that the reference genome is to be downloaded to the `/data/genome` directory:

```
/data/
    genomes/
        sacCer2/
            sacCer2.fa
```

You should adapt the configuration file to your own file organization. 
Data is downloadable from the GEO platform. The automatic downloading is soon to be integrated in the workflow. 

# Workflow execution

The workflow has to include the configuration file using this code:
```
configfile: "examples/GSE20870/GSE20870.yml"
```
You can then chose what program(s) to use for mapping and peak-calling by commenting/uncommenting the following line:

```
ALIGNER=[
#    "bowtie",
    "bowtie2",
#    "bwa"
]
```
```
PEAKCALLER=[
    "homer-fdr" + config["homer"]["fdr"] + "_peaks", 
    "macs2-qval" + config["macs2"]["qval"], 
    "swembl-R" + config["swembl"]["R"],
#    "macs14-pval" + config["macs14"]["pval"],
#    "spp-fdr" + config["spp"]["fdr"],
#    "bPeaks_allGenome"
]
```


The workflow generates a flowchart of the analysis:

# Purpose of this repository

This git repository holds shared code for the analysis of Next
Generation Sequencing data related to gene regulation: ChIP-seq,
RNA-seq, and related technologies.

The goals are multiple.

1. Avoid duplication of efforts by sharing the developments of
different bioinformaticians involved in ChIP-seq and RNA-seq projects.

2. Ensure portability and re-usability of the code.

3. Enable validation of the code by independent users.



### Execution 

The file `factor_workflow.py` is designed to perform ChIP-seq analysis on transcription factor studies. 

Two associated config files are designed to work with this workflow: `Athaliana-Myb.yml` and `Scerevisiae-GCN4.yml`.

In order to launch the workflows, you can enter the following commands from the root of the repository:

```
snakemake -s scripts/snakefiles/workflows/factor_workflow.py --configfile examples/Scerevisiae-GCN4/Scerevisiae-GCN4.yml -p -n
snakemake -s scripts/snakefiles/workflows/factor_workflow.py --configfile examples/Athaliana-Myb/Athaliana-Myb.yml -p -n
```
This ensures the workflows are executable. Remove the -n option to actually run them.

## RNA-seq (TODO)

# Documentation

More documentation can be found in the `doc` directory. (under construction)

It includes: 

* Instructions for the installation of dependencies (to be refhreshed)
* RSAT install guide (to be refreshed)
